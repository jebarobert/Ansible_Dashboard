## Create a React App:
Run the following command in your terminal: **npx create-react-app my-app**.

## Install Bootstrap:
To use Bootstrap in your React app, you can install it by running: **npm install bootstrap**.

## The Project Structure:
After setting up all the components the project structure will look like this:

Within the component, there's a structured layout:

- A header (imported from Header.js) at the top.
- A personalized greeting message for the user.
- A display of course categories with counts and colors.
- A list of courses (imported from Courses.js), including their titles and status icons.
- A section displaying test schedules (imported from TestSchedule.js).
- The background of the entire content area is styled with a light purple color.

## Final Steps:
We've assembled all the components, and now it's time to launch the live dashboard by running 'npm start'.

The dashboard will look like this:
